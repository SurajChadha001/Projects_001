**Smart Health Disease  Prediction using Django and Machine Learning**
This project is a web-based application designed to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms. Built with Django, the application serves as an interface for users to input their health parameters and receive a prediction regarding their risk of heart disease. The machine learning model is trained on the UCI Heart Disease dataset.

**Features**
User authentication system.
Form for entering medical parameters (age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.).
Real-time prediction using a trained machine learning model.
Dashboard for visualizing past results (for logged-in users).
